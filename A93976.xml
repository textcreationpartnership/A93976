            <title>A Strange and true relation of a wonderful and terrible earth-quake, that hapned at Hereford on Tuesday last, being the first of this present October, 1661. Whereby a church-steeple and many gallant houses were thrown down to the ground, and several of the inhabitants slain; with the terrible thunder-claps and violent storm of great hail-stones that then fell, which were about the bigness of an egge, many cattle thereby utterly destroyed as they were feeding in the field. Also, the prodigious and wonderful apparitions that were seen in the air, to the great amazement of all spectators, who beheld two perfect armes and hands: in the right-hand being graspt a great broad sword, and in the left, a bowl full of blood, from whence they heard a most strange and loud voice, to the wonderful astonishing of all present, the fright whereof causing divers women to fall in travel, amongst whom the clerks wife, named Margaret Pelmore, fell in labour, and brought forth three male-children, who had all teeth, and spake as soon as they were born, and presently after gave up the ghost and died together, the like having never been known before in any age! The truth hereof is witnessed by Francis Smalman, and Henry Cross, churchwardens. Peter Philpot. constable. [double brace] Nicholas Finch, Gent. James Tulley, Gent. George Cox, Robert Morris, Thomas Welford, &amp;c.</title>

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>And now to deſcend to the ſubject I was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſpeaking of, which was of the violent Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt and terrible Earthquake, &amp;c. that hapned at Hereford, be pleaſed to obſerve the true Relation thereof, which is thus:</p>
            <p>ON Tueſday laſt, being the firſt of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent October, 1661. about 2 of the clock after Noon, there hapned a great and violent ſtorm to ariſe, to the amazing and aſtoniſhing of all the inhabitants: The firſt beginning was with a moſt terrible Winde, which continued for
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:172374:3"/>the ſpace of 2 hours, with ſuch vehemency, that it forced the Tiles off the Houſes, inſomuch, that none durſt come out at their doors; in the midſt of which ſtorm, was blown down the Steeple of a Church, and many brave Houſes, the falling whereof hath killed ſome perſons, but what they are, or whom we yet know not.</p>
            <p>Then the Air began to be darkned, but ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly clearing again the people began to look ab<gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>oad; and ſo continuing for a while, all aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>redly thought the ſtorm to be over, but contrary to their hopes, about 6 and 7 of the clock in the Evening, their Ears were ſolicited with unwonted Claps of Thunder; and, more to augment their fear, preſently fell ſuch Hail-ſtones, that the like was never ſeen in any Age before, each Hailſtone being about the bigneſs of an Egge, which ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gentlemen of quality affirm, <gap reason="illegible" extent="1 letter">
